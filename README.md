Notes and small experiments while learning applied software and AI

This repository documents my learning and small experiments as a Computer Engineering Student, independently learning on applied software and AI.

Goals:
- Build consistency
- Learn fundamentals
- Create a visible learning trail

Currently and will always be a work in progress.
